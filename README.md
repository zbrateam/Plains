# Plains
Plains is an Objective-C based framework for interfacing with libapt. It is built to support iOS 12 (or other platform equivalent) and later.

## Building
If you want to compile Plains yourself all that is needed is a computer running macOS that has Xcode installed.

Testing Plains requires a device with `libapt-pkg.6.0` installed. On both macOS and iOS currently this requires a Procursus bootstrap.

**This branch is currently not intended for public use. We will not be handling any issues or pull requests raised in this regard.**
